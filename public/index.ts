This synchronization ensures that user profiles are always up-to-date with the latest information.
Using Clerk's webhooks, we handle user data updates efficiently. When a user profile is created or modified, a webhook event triggers our server to process and update the corresponding data in our MongoDB database. This approach follows the latest authentication best practices, ensuring secure and reliable data handling.
Additionally, our application manages complex array fields and forms with ease. The combination of React Hook Form and Zod validation allows us to build dynamic and flexible forms, enhancing user interaction and data validation.`,

Modern Tech Stack: Built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and TypeScript, the app leverages Refresh Tokens with Axios interceptors for secure and seamless authentication.

Challenges and Solutions:

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was the organization of the Backend and Database to handle complex relationships between products, categories, and customer transactions. By utilizing advanced hooks and caching strategies, the app maintains high performance while ensuring data consistency across the platform.

Technologies Used:

React.js (with Hooks)
TypeScript
Node.js & Express.js
MongoDB
JWT Authentication with Refresh Tokens
Axios Interceptors
Outcome:

The final product is a powerful tool for wholesalers, providing them with an all-in-one solution to manage their business operations efficiently. The app's ability to track detailed financial records, manage inventory, and handle customer relations in real-time makes it an indispensable asset for users.
